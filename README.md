# DiscreteMath-Graph-Theory-Final
This is my final project for my Discrete Mathematics Class. In this project I have talked about the importance of graph theory and algorithms with going into detail about Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithms and talking about the importance and what are BFS algorithms.
